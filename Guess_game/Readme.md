# Guess the Number or Letter Game 🎲🔠

This interactive guessing game, built with Streamlit and Python, lets players choose between guessing a number or a letter. The game features multiple difficulty levels, score tracking, and a high score system, making it fun and challenging for players of all ages!

## 🎮 Gameplay

Players choose between two modes:
- **Guess a Number**: Guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.
- **Guess a Letter**: Guess a randomly generated letter from 'a' to 'z'.

Each game mode has multiple difficulty levels, affecting the number of attempts allowed and the scoring system. Players receive feedback for each guess (too high, too low, etc.) and are rewarded with points based on their performance. High scores are tracked separately for each mode.

## 🏆 Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties to increase or decrease the range of numbers or allowed attempts.
- **Score System**: Earn points based on the number of attempts taken. The fewer attempts, the higher the score!
- **High Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the best scores achieved in each mode.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Gives instant feedback on each guess to guide the player toward the correct answer.

## 📋 How to Play

1. **Choose a Game Mode**: Use the sidebar to select "Guess a Number" or "Guess a Letter."
2. **Set the Difficulty Level**: Choose Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty from the sidebar. Each difficulty adjusts the range of numbers/attempts or available points.
3. **Make Your Guesses**:

   - For **Guess a Letter**, enter a letter from 'a' to 'z'.
