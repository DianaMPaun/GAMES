    "# Escape Room Adventure Game\n",
    "## About the Game\n",
    "Welcome to the Escape Room Adventure, where you find yourself locked inside a mysterious mansion with various rooms. Your goal is to solve puzzles, uncover clues, and escape before time runs out! You’ll face challenges involving logic, science, and magic, as you navigate through different rooms, each with its own unique puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rooms in the Game\n",
    "### The Dark Study: A dimly lit room filled with bookshelves. The titles of the books hold vital clues. There’s an old clock showing \"5 minutes to midnight,\" and you’ll need to find a secret 4-digit code to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Elemental Chamber: A circular room with symbols of the elements. You must place objects representing earth, water, fire, and air in the correct order to unlock a clue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Labyrinth of Mirrors: A room where light reflects off mirrors. Align the mirrors correctly to direct the beam of light to the hidden switch that unlocks a secret door.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Play\n",
    "- The game starts with a timer set for 5 minutes. Your task is to explore each room, find clues, and solve puzzles to escape the mansion before time runs out.\n",
    "- Type commands to explore or examine the items in each room. For example:\n",
    "explore will list all interactable objects in the room.\n",
    "examine <item> will give more details about the object, and in some cases, prompt you to interact with it (e.g., rotating mirrors in the Labyrinth of Mirrors).\n",
    "- Once all puzzles are solved, you’ll escape the mansion. Your final time will be displayed if you succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commands:\n",
    "- explore: Lists the objects in the room.\n",
    "- examine <item>: Investigates the chosen object.\n",
    "Solve puzzles by following the clues, like rotating mirrors, mixing ingredients, or finding hidden switches.\n",
    "## Good luck escaping before midnight!"
